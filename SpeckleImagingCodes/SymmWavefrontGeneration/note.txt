3-5 meters per second at ground layer
28 meters per second at 11 kilometers
15 meters per second at 16 kilometers

Think about pixel size in terms of meters

2 miliseconds for sampling time


Some other questions -- how to do amplitude estimation?

If you don't have wavefront sensor data, what to do?
Use spectral holes, and other spectral data.
How to do slick implementation of this?

Uncderstand spectral ratio and spectral holes in my
own language -- get better understanding of this.

How to cascade several frozen flows together -- if we have
a minutes worth of data, break it up into 10 different
FFH time frames, and then cascade together.  Different
FFH problems can be solved separately, and then tied
together.

------------------

Generate polychromatic PSF (600 mm -- 900 mm)
this is an integration problem.

Given phi(k), k = 1:nframes.  Then

for k = 1:nframes
  for lambda = lambda_min : lambda_max
    * stretch/shrink phi(k) (keep hard edge)
    * scale (multiply by some scalar found by ratio of wavelengths)
    * compute PSF
    * accumulate sum of PSFs
  end
  nomalize PSFs (sum to one)
end
